                                            <p>Babita overcomes her disability and rewrites her future
Babita used to study at a government school in a village called Vasdev. SSISM met her during a career counseling session of 12th standard students.

Babita is Polio affected since childhood. She has a big family. Her father is a laborer, and her mother is a housewife. She has 5 siblings; two elder brothers who work as masons, one younger sister Mamta, who is a graduate but unemployed, and one brother who is a truck driver. Babita and her younger sister Mamta are the only two graduates amongst her siblings. Mamta was not allowed to work due to familial pressures.

During counseling, she told the organization that she wants to do something in life. She wants to help her family. Her poor financial condition and being differently abled makes it impossible for her to get a higher education. </p>

                                            <p>Every monthly donation helps more kids like Bairavi get midday meals
Bairavi's father is a daily wage labourer but due to ill-health can't work regularly. The house they live in has a leaky roof and unhygienic surroundings. Even one meal a day is a distant dream for them. Isha Vidya convinced the parents to admit her to the Isha school after promising scholarship.

Through a medical camp conducted in the school, Bairavi was diagnosed as under-nourished and anemic. After regular intake of the nutritious and tasty mid-day meal with proteins, she started to gain strength. By the second medical camp, her weight was normal and she is no longer anemic.

Unfortunately, a mid-day meal is the only good meal a poor child gets and this program helps a child with the basic right to a hot meal.
